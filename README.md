# HI! I'm LeftelfinX! 👋🏼

## 🚀 About Me
I'm **Leftelfin**, a passionate computer enthusiast and self-hosting geek. I love tinkering with Linux, exploring server setups, and working on open-source projects. I have been using Arch Linux as my daily driver for almost **2 years**, and I enjoy experimenting with different tech stacks (😅 **I just waste my whole day doing something on my PC!!**). 

I also have experience with **server setups** like Proxmox, TrueNAS, and various self-hosted services, running on my **dedicated server** built from old gaming PC parts.
